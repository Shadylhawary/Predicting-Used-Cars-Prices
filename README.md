# Used Car Price Prediction [**Machine Learning**]
This repo holds an algorithm to predict used cars market value to help both buyers and sellers to determine the cost range of the car before taking any action.
### Dataset & Features
 - Data were collected by scraping available Ads across the Egyptian selling used cars websites, >40K Ad were collected with a maximum 2 month time variance.
 - The features available for this dataset are Make, Model, Year, Mileage and Price
 - Correlation heatmap shows that the year and mileage has higher weight in computing the price.

### Algorithm

Machine learning is part art and part science. When you look at machine learning algorithms, there is no one solution or one approach that fits all. There are several factors that can affect your decision to choose a machine learning algorithm.

**In My Case**: I Choosed KNN over SVM algortihm, almost both gives me the same accuracy range 70%-76%.

###### Important Note
The data is encoded by Sklearn preproceesing Label encoder and sorry pickle files of the encoder will not be uploaded :)
*Data Collected is not for commerical use, just for learning and learning and learning.*
